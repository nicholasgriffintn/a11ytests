        <h2>Improper Title Attribute</h2>
        <div class="issue">
          <p><strong>WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)</strong>: For all user interface components, the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.</p>
          <p>There is content <span title="hello">but this span should not have a title attribute</span> without providing additional context.</p>
          <p>Title attributes are problematic for accessibility as they are not consistently announced by screen readers and are not visible to all users.</p>
